# SiGiNT
The insecure non-signal messenger.

[Signal](https://signal.org) is a *secure* messenger app which auto-updates and does not support chromebooks. This is none of those things.

This is an fork of an older version of Signal which was installable as a google chrome extension, so that I can use it on my chromebook.

If you don't have to use this, you shouldn't. If you are worried about your security, you also shouldn't, if you're using a chromebook and you want to be able to chat with people on signal *by any means necessary*, welcome to the swamp.

## How to install

1. Download [sigint-dist.zip](https://github.com/cjdelisle/sigint)
2. Unzip `sigint-dist.zip` so you have the dist folder somewhere in your directory
3. Open chrome and type in `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (upper/right)
5. Click "Load unpacket" (upper/left)
6. Select the `/dist` folder in the menu
7. Congratulations, you have something vaguely like signal

## Will it ever be updated ?

probably not, auto-update will never happen

## What if there's a security vulnerability ?

bad things

## This is a terrible idea

don't use it
